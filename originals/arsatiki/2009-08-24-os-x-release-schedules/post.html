<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/" rel="nofollow">Snow Leopard</a>, the new version of OS X, is available on Friday. Many people in Twitter proclaimed that they had pre-ordered the latest cat. I’ve chosen to wait until 10.6.1 or maybe even 10.6.2. The .0 version invariably has bugs that surface only after release.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Past experience tells me that I don’t have to wait for too long for the first update. However, I like data even more than I like experience. I took the release dates for previous OS X updates from Wikipedia and computed the average time between .0 and .1. This turned out to be 25 days.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>Out of sheer geekery, I plotted the rest of the data on the same chart. The points on the chart represent different releases. The x-axis measures the days from .0 release and the y-axis is the sub-minor version.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>The first update is usually out within a month. The variance is greater for the second version, but 10.6.2 is probably out before the year is over.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>If you want the cleaned data for your own nefarious purposes, please add a comment or send me an email. My email address is the first part of my posterous domain + the country code for Finland, i.e. .fi.</div>
