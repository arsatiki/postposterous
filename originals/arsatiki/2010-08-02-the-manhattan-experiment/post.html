The name of my experiment is unfortunate. I have no good feelings toward the development of the atomics. However, what I am doing is an experiment and the method of experimentation is the Manhattan. <br /><br />I use the Manhattan Experiment to gauge (one aspect of) the quality of an establishment. Put simply, I’ll try to order a Manhattan cocktail in a bar. The results range from delicious to hilarious and the occasional frackful afwulness. <br /><br />The history of the experiment traces back to my honeymoon trip. On the first night we stayed at a Nairobi hotel before starting our five-day Safari. We had dinner at the hotel restaurant. The aperitif list did not look appealing. It had all your usual suspects and a variety of different fruit cocktails. I however wanted something “classy.” <br /><br />I ordered a Manhattan. There was no real motive behind the choice. The drink has some significance to my friends and I, as we’ve used it as a palliative the night before the Big Day. <br /><br />The waiter gave me a Type I (see below) response: “I’m sorry sir, it is not possible.” <br /><br />The next day we travelled to a lodge near Mt. Kenya. Not getting the Manhattan had stayed with me. After the day’s safari we walked by the lodge bar and I casually ordered a Manhattan. <br /><br />The bartender set to work. He looked the recipe up, whipped out an impressive selection of bartending machinery and mixed me my drink. The process took a while, but in the end I had Type IV specimen in my hand: a well done Manhattan. <br /><br />We stayed in four more hotels during the trip. I ordered (or tried to) a Manhattan in each one of them. Since then, ordering a Manhattan has become a habit. <br /><br />I use a four level system for grading the results. <br /><br />I - No drink. Subtypes: <br />Ia) “What’s a Manhattan?” Usually leads to type III results. <br />Ib) The honest “impossible” response. <br /><br />II - Wrong drink. The bartender does not know the drink and mixes me something. <br /><br />III - Wrong preparation. Subtypes: <br />IIIa) Wrong proportions. <br />IIIb) Insufficient ice or no ice at all. <br />IIIc) Watered down drink. <br /><br />IV) A well done Manhattan. <br /><br /><br />Manhattan fits this kind of experiment well. It is a classic, but not as common as e.g. the Martini. It easy to make and yet easy to screw up. It tastes goooood. The recipe allows for some individual creativity. It is easy to pronounce and understand. I simply cannot emphasize the last point enough. Try ordering a Corpse Reviver Number Two in any noisy bar or in Africa...
