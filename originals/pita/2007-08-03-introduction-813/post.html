<p>Hello and welcome to <em>Pythonic Introduction to Algorithms</em>! The purpose of this blog is teach me deeper algorithm magic and hopefully work as a useful resource for a larger audience.</p></p><p>A longer introduction </p><p><p>The spark behind this project was my horrible failure at the 2007 <a href="http://www.icfpcontest.org/" rel="nofollow">ICFP Programming Contest</a>. In the final analysis, it turned out that I have a true treasure in my bookshelf -- the Cormen &amp; al. <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em> (1st ed.). I have rarely opened it since the spring of my freshman year (i.e. 1999).</p>
<p>While the book does give you the pseudo-code, there is small conversion step that must be done. For example, the book uses 1-based arrays while Python uses 0-based. There are also several other features in the newer Python releases that allow more Pythonic implementations of the pseudo-code.</p></p><p>What about this blog, then? </p><p><p>This brings us finally to the raison d'etre of the blog. <em>I</em> can fill the gaps in my algorithm knowledge by actually going through the book and implementing as many algorithms as possible. <em>You</em> can benefit by not having to worry about off-by-ones, accidental <em>O(N)</em> → <em>O(N²)</em> transformations &amp;c.</p></p><p><p>I hope to post an entry roughly once a week. I will also try to go through the chapters in order, but exceptions may occur. I will not include other material from the book than the algorithms themselves and their short descriptions -- I respect the work of the authors. If you need the proofs and the explanations and all the rest, buy the book. You can also check out the <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Electrical-Engineering-and-Computer-Science/6-046JFall-2005/CourseHome/index.htm" rel="nofollow">MIT OpenCourseWare page for the course</a>.</p>
<p>As for the edition, I will use the first edition. I have no pressing need to buy the newer edition -- unless you'd like to donate me a copy… =)</p></p><p><p>That's it. I'll appreciate any feedback, especially if the algorithm implementations are WRONG or TOO SLOW. You can best reach me by email. My address can be found with the Python interpreter:</p><blockquote class="posterous_short_quote"><code>print '@'.join(('ars', 'iki.fi'))</code></blockquote></p><p>Why Python? Why not Ruby? Why not ...? <p>Python has been my weapon of choice since the year 2000. Not quite the tin anniversary yet, but there is a great deal of inertia.And as I've said above, new languages are not my learning goal here =)</p>
