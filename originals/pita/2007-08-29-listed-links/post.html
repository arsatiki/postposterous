<p>Pun intended.</p></p><p><p>I found two articles on data structures and algorithms which referenced Python.</p></p><p><p>The first one is the golden oldie, Guido's article about <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs.html" rel="nofollow">implementing graphs</a> with dicts. I will most likely use this approach as my starting point, although I believe I'll replace adjacency lists with adjacency sets.</p></p><p><p>The second one is a paper on <a href="http://www.ece.uci.edu/~chou/py02/python.html" rel="nofollow">algorithm education in Python</a>. Fantastic stuff. I especially liked the following quote:</p>
<blockquote class="posterous_medium_quote"> We were criticized for trying to make programming "too soft" for engineering students, and we were asked "if C ain't broke, why fix it?" Our response was that we want to teach <em>problem solving</em> skills, not just <em>programming</em>, and we are confident that Python will be a much more effective way to introduce the fundamental concepts than C.</blockquote>
<p>I recently had the priviledge of seeing some C-related exams from my <a href="http://www.tkk.fi/" rel="nofollow">alma mater</a>. A large portion of the questions was focused on some of the hairier parts of the syntax, such as function pointers, very unhygienic macros and so on. I don't think many of the students walk out of that test thinking "C is a useful tool in solving many everyday problems". I think they'll be cursing.</p>
