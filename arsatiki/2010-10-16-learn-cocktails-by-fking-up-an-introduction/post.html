<p>In cooking, the end result depends on both the ingredients and the skill of the cook. The same applies also to cocktails. It is easy to follow the first part of the instruction: don’t buy the cheapest stuff and use fresh juice whenever possible.</p>
<p>However, learning the skills requires a lot of trial and error. This is usually not really possible for a hobbyist like myself. Unlike professional bartenders, I have a clientele of one. There is only a limited amount of alcohol I can consume during one session. Here cocktails and cooking differ the most.</p>
<p>As you can guess, my progress has been rather slow. Occasionally I make a drink that disappoints me, but I can not pinpoint the reason. The drink “tastes flat.” The drink “is missing something.” The drink “looks ugly.” It is hard to map the sensations of the mouth into actual steps in preparation.</p>
<p>I recently figured out a way to learn the proper technique. Instead of trying to make the perfect drink, make a deliberately <em>bad</em> cocktail. This lets you learn how different steps affect the taste and texture. This, in turn, leads to faster feedback when mixing cocktails and accelerates overall learning.</p>
<p>In essence, this is a form of deliberate practice that tries to get as much learning out of a centiliter of booze as possible. I will outline the method below and post a series of experiments further as examples.</p>
<p>Step 1: Pick a recipe. If this is your first step into the world of cocktails, make it something simple. I will use the Martini.</p>
<p>Step 2, the yummy: Establish a baseline. Go get a sample of the cocktail in a decent bar. You can try to make one yourself as well. </p>
<p>Step 3: List ways the cocktail could go wrong. These will be your experiments. If you repeat this process with another cocktail, you will note that many items on the list are the same. Feel free to omit some of the common items when you have more experience.</p>
<p>Here is a quick list for the Martini:</p>
<ul>
<li>no ice / wet ice</li>
<li>bad ingredients (e.g. cheap gin)</li>
<li>shaking instead of stirring</li>
<li>wrong glass</li>
<li>no garnish.</li>
</ul><p>Step 4: Try to make the perfect cocktail, but make one (and JUST ONE) of the items you listed in the previous step. <strong>Make notes </strong>of how the taste and texture differ.</p>
<p>After a few experiments, try to make the perfect drink. Odds are you can now better tell what could be improved in the cocktail. Perhaps the ice was too wet and diluted the drink too much. Perhaps the vermouth has lost its will to live. Better feedback, faster learning.</p>
<p>In the next post I will look at the Martini and the role of ice.</p>
