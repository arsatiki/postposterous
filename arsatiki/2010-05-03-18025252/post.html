<p>Having several Posterous blogs is a neat feature.</p>
<p>I find it easier to write when I can narrow down the topic somewhat. A new topic, a new blog.</p>
<p>I am “rebranding” this blog to focus more on technical parts of my life. I expect to write about the same sort of things as in the last few posts. I hope to do it more often.</p>
