<div>The above image, built with Wordle, shows the most common words that occur in a collection of cocktail recipes. I had roughly a hundred recipes.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I've removed the words <em>oz</em>, <em>1/2</em> (and other fractions) and <em>glass</em>, which were the most common words. Unfortunately they were so common that they completely dominated the wordle. And there's not much insight in the fact that you drink cocktails from a glass.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>As I expected, <em>ice</em> is the most common word followed closely by <em>juice</em>. I'm surprised by the relationship between <em>vodka</em> and <em>gin</em>, though.</div>
<div><br /></div>
<div>I'd love to redo this with a larger dataset. Contact me if you have one.</div>
