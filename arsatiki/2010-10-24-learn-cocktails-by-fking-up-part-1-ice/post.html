<p>Some time ago I made a wordle out of <a href="http://arsatiki.posterous.com/cocktail-wordle" rel="nofollow">words that appear in cocktail recipes</a>. Ice completely dominated the chart. Ice is fundamentally important in making good cocktails, as we understand cocktailing today. I’ll take a roundabout way of explaining why.</p>
<p>What we experience as a “taste” is in fact a combination of what our tongue, nose, eyes and expectations tell us. We only taste five different tastes: sweet, sour, bitter, salt and the umami. Sweet and sour the most common ones in cocktails, others not so much. Herbal liquers and aromatic garnishes such as lemon can make or break a cocktail by stimulating or not stimulating the nose.</p>
<p>Almost all cocktails are served cold. Coldness both improves the mouthfeel and masks some of the raw alcohol burn. Both effects are rather large, which today’s experiment will reveal.</p>
<p>As an aside, the focus on ice is a remnant from history. Refridgerators were not common in the 19th century. In contrast, it was relatively easy to keep ice from melting. I will investigate a Martini made out of refridgerated ingredients at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Ice is not the only remnant of the past. Many cocktail practices of today can be traced back to early efforts of making alcohol taste drinkable. Fortunately for us, some of these efforts produced complex and entertaining drinks.</p>
 Preparation 
<p>I used Bombay Sapphire as the gin and Noilly Prat as the vermouth. Both are kept in <strong>room temperature</strong>. I used a 2:1 ratio of gin to vermouth. I stirred both ingredients in a <strong>icefree</strong> glass for 30 seconds, poured the drink into a cocktail glass and garnished with an olive.</p>
<p>I did not chill the glass.</p>
<p>(Of course, the stirring has very limited effect now that the ice has gone missing.)</p>
 Tasting notes 
<p>I have used the same ingredients to make a reference Martini several times, except that I store the vermouth in the fridge.</p>
<p>This one... Ewh.</p>
<p>The gin is far too overpowering and the afterburn takes far too long. The mouthfeel reminds me of sticky oil and not of the bright steel -like quality of a good well-chilled Martini.</p>
<p>The nose is rather good, though.</p>
<p>In summary, the Martini taste is there, but the feel is wrong. This is not a good drink.</p>
<p>Don’t take my word for this. My experience is subjective and I can’t fully communicate all the nuances of the result. Do the experiment yourself and see what happens.</p>
