<p>Quicksort is another chapter that does not really need Pythonizing. The only gotcha is the <code>repeat ... until</code> loop. You have to write that as a <code>while</code> loop. The required transformation is below:</p></p><p><code>body()
while condition:
    body()</code></p><p><p>Another interesting transformation would be to use iteration instead of recursion. I am omitting it here, since all you need to do is to use your own stack to replace the call stack. See problem 8-4.</p></p><p><p>Lomuto's partition algorithm was wnother gem hidden in the murky waters of Problems Bay. I feel it is clearer than the standard version as the pointers move in the same direction.</p></p><p><p>There is rarely any need to implement quicksort these days. Although sorting algorithms are among the first ones studied at school, modern languages and libraries offer it <em>Ã  la carte</em>. Such is life.</p>
